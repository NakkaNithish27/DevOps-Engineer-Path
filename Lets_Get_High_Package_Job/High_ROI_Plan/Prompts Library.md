## 4. Track 1 – Core Technical Building

```markdown
## Track 1 – Core Technical Building

Use the attached **Project Specification**, **DevOps Career Roadmap**, and **Project Progress Tracker** as the project context.

Then use this article to complete the **Core Technical Building** track for today's learning session.

Before starting, classify this topic into one of these categories:

* 🟢 **Follow (20%)** — Mindset: *"If I forget this in six months, I can confidently follow the documentation again."*

* 🟡 **Understand (60%)** — Mindset: *"If someone asks me how this works, I should be able to explain the flow without looking at notes."*

* 🔴 **Troubleshoot (100%)** — Mindset: *"If this breaks in production at 2 AM, I should know where to start investigating."*

Briefly explain why you chose that category and tell me where I should spend my mental effort during this learning session.

Then:

* Give me a quick theory refresher (2–3 minutes) based on the **Theory** section.
* Dump the entire **Practical** section as-is in a clean, reader-friendly format (split it into multiple parts if it's too long).
* After the Practical section, dump the entire **Mental Compression Map** section as-is in a clean, reader-friendly format.
* Keep production tips and troubleshooting minimal, and only include them when absolutely necessary.
* Do not omit, summarize, or skip any practical steps or Mental Compression Map content.

  * **Phase 5:** Conduct comprehensive interview preparation, mock interviews, and job conversion activities.
* If there are interview tasks to complete now, guide me through them in the recommended order (e.g., concept revision, interview questions, hands-on reasoning, troubleshooting scenarios, mock interviews, resume preparation, etc.).
* At the end of the session, assign confidence scores for the technology covered today:

  * Recognition
  * Recall
  * Application (if applicable)
  * Troubleshooting (if applicable)
  * Overall Confidence
* Recommend revision only when the confidence score indicates it is necessary.
* If a deliverable should be deferred because it will be more valuable after completing future topics, projects, or iterations, clearly explain why and tell me to wait.

## 7.2 Prompt — Interview Answer Reviewer
~~~markdown
## Prompt — Interview Answer Reviewer

Use the attached **Project Specification**, **DevOps Career Roadmap**, and **Project Progress Tracker** as the project context.

My answers are responses to interview questions based on the technologies and topics completed so far in the roadmap.

Assume I answered **without looking at notes**.

The objective of this prompt is **not** to generate interview questions.

Its only responsibility is to review and improve my interview answers.

For **every answer I provide**, perform the following:

---

## 1. My Answer

Show **my original answer exactly as I wrote it**.

* Do **not** rewrite it.
* Do **not** correct it.
* Do **not** improve it.
* Preserve my wording so I can compare it with the improved version.

---

## 2. Interview Quality Improvement

Internally evaluate my answer for:

* Missing technical concepts.
* Incorrect understanding.
* Weak or imprecise wording.
* Missing interview points.
* Incomplete explanations.

Do **not** show this internal evaluation.

Instead, provide a rewritten answer that:

* Preserves my current level of technical knowledge.
* Fills only the important knowledge gaps appropriate for my current roadmap stage.
* Uses accurate technical terminology naturally.
* Sounds like an engineer with approximately **3–5 years of DevOps experience** answering in a technical interview.
* Remains completely aligned with the technologies and concepts I have already completed.
* Does **not** introduce advanced topics from future roadmap sections simply to make the answer sound more senior.
* Produces an answer that I could realistically explain during a real interview.

---

## 3. Why This Answer Is Better

Briefly explain why the improved answer is stronger.

Focus on improvements such as:

* Better technical terminology.
* More complete explanation.
* Better logical structure.
* More professional interview wording.
* Important concepts that were added.
* Improved clarity.

Do **not** critique my original answer line by line.

The objective is to teach me how experienced engineers communicate the same technical knowledge professionally.

---

# General Rules

* Review every answer independently.
* Preserve the intent of my original answer whenever possible.
* Correct factual mistakes.
* Fill important knowledge gaps appropriate to my current roadmap stage.
* Keep answers concise but interview-ready.
* Optimize for real technical interviews rather than textbook definitions.
* Show my original answer before the improved answer so I can easily compare the two.
* Do not ask follow-up questions unless my answer is too ambiguous to improve accurately.
* Do not introduce technologies, production practices, or concepts that belong to future sections of the roadmap.
* The goal is to help me progressively improve both my **technical understanding** and my **professional interview communication**, not simply to provide model answers.

---

# Output Size Management

Before generating the review, **estimate whether the complete interview review can fit within a single response**.

* If the complete review fits within one response, generate it normally.

* If the complete review is too large to fit within a single response, **do not begin the review immediately**.

Instead, first provide **only** an execution plan using the following format:

```text
The complete interview review is too large to fit in a single response.

It will be delivered in X parts.

Part 1
- Questions X–Y

Part 2
- Questions X–Y

...

Reply with:

"Part 1"

to begin.
```

After that:

* Generate **only** the requested part when I ask for it (e.g., "Part 1", "Part 2", etc.).
* Continue exactly where the previous part ended.
* Do **not** repeat content from previous parts.
* Do **not** skip any interview questions.
* Maintain the same output structure for every question throughout all parts.
* Continue until the complete interview review has been delivered.

## 4. Recall Mapping

Create a **Recall Mapping** for the improved interview answer.

For **each sentence** in the improved answer, generate a recall trigger using the following format:

```text
Short trigger phrase → "Original sentence"
```

Rules:

* Copy each sentence from the improved answer **verbatim** and map it to a recall trigger.
* The trigger phrase should be **3–7 words**.
* The trigger should be optimized for **active recall**, **not summarization**.
* The trigger should contain just enough information for me to reconstruct the original sentence after reading the improved answer once.
* If a trigger is too vague to reliably reconstruct the sentence after a week, make it slightly more descriptive.
* If a trigger is almost identical to the original sentence, shorten it.
* Generate **one trigger per sentence**.
* Do **not** rewrite, simplify, or paraphrase the original sentence.
* Do **not** use emojis, mnemonics, explanations, or additional notes.
* Output **only** the recall mapping.

##  8.0 Tell ai about all tracks result

## 8.1 Progress Tracker Log
~~~markdown
Go through the attached PDF containing this entire chat conversation and the attached Progress_Tracker document containing previous session logs.

Generate a concise Markdown session log that records the highest-value permanent outcomes of this session.

The log should function as an append-only execution history for the project, documenting only information that will remain useful in future sessions.

Include, where applicable:

Completed work and milestones reached.

Important decisions or changes in direction.

Significant problems encountered and their resolutions.

Files, documents, or major artifacts created or modified.

Important insights or conclusions that affect future work.

The logical next starting point for the project.


Do not include:

Unfinished discussions.

Abandoned ideas.

Brainstorming or conversational filler.

Step-by-step learning notes or explanations unless they produced a lasting project decision.

Minor implementation details that can be recovered from project files or documentation.


Prioritize recording what changed rather than everything that was discussed. If several related tasks were completed, summarize them together instead of listing every individual activity.

Write naturally without following a fixed template or mandatory headings. Organize the information in whatever structure best reflects the completed work.

Assume someone will read this log months later to understand the project's evolution. Include enough context for continuity, but avoid repeating information already captured in previous session logs unless it changed during this session.

Target approximately 150–300 words. If very little was accomplished, write less. If an unusually large amount was accomplished, remain concise by recording only the most important outcomes.

Return only the Markdown content, enclosed in a fenced Markdown code block, ready to append to the end of Progress_Tracker.md.

End the output with a horizontal rule (---) to serve as the session separator.
